# Getting Started with Project Brayford

Welcome to Project Brayford! This guide will help you create your first live interactive event.

## What is Project Brayford?

Project Brayford is a real-time engagement platform that connects you with your audience during live events such as podcasts, webinars, and creator shows. Your audience can ask questions, vote in polls, and engage directly whilst you maintain full control through moderation.

## Key Concepts

### Organisations

Your organisation is the top-level container for all your content. It handles billing and team member access.

### Brands

Brands are your public-facing identities. You can create multiple brands under one organisation—for example, you might have different brands for different show formats or audiences.

### Events

Events are where the magic happens. Each event is a live session where your audience can interact. Events belong to a brand and can include multiple interaction modules like Q&A and polls.

## Quick Start

1. **Create your first brand** in Organisation Settings
2. **Set up an event** from the Dashboard
3. **Add interaction modules** (Q&A, polls, etc.)
4. **Go live** when you're ready
5. **Share the QR code** with your audience
