# Getting Started with Project Brayford

Welcome to Project Brayford! This guide will help you create your first live interactive event.

## What is Project Brayford?

Project Brayford is a real-time engagement platform that connects you with your audience during live events such as podcasts, webinars, and creator shows. Your audience can ask questions, vote in polls, and engage directly whilst you maintain full control through moderation.

## Key Concepts

### Organisations

Everyone who uses Project Brayford joins an organisation. It's the umbrella under which everything else sits.

If you run a production company called Acme Productions, your "Acme Productions" organisation would contain your team members, brands and events.

### Brands

Brands are your public-facing identities.

Let's imagine you have a podcast called "The Acme Podcast".

The Acme Podcast _brand_ would contain all the information Project Brayford needs to know about it: How it appears to audience members, and who from your team is allowed to access it.

Having multiple brands means you can swap your branding in and out easily for different events, without having to re-upload images, text and settings every time.

### Events

This is where the magic happens.

Each event is a live session where your audience can interact.

Audiences will scan in to a particular event, and you can manage their experience from the events dashboard.

## Quick Start

1. **Create your first brand** in Organisation Settings
2. **Set up an event** from the Dashboard
3. **Add interaction modules** (Q&A, polls, etc.)
4. **Go live** when you're ready
5. **Share the QR code** with your audience
