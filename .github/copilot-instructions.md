# Copilot Instructions - Project Brayford

## Ways of Working

**Collaboration principles for this project:**

### 🚫 Do NOT write code without explicit consent

- **Never start implementing** without confirming the approach first
- Ask clarifying questions before proposing solutions
- Present options and wait for direction rather than choosing for me
- If uncertain about requirements, discuss before coding

### ✅ DO prioritize alignment over speed

- **Accuracy and collaboration > proactivity and helpfulness**
- Propose a plan and get approval before execution
- Check assumptions explicitly ("Should I...?", "Would you prefer...?")
- When multiple approaches exist, outline trade-offs and ask which to pursue
- If I ask for analysis, provide analysis - don't jump to implementation

### 💬 Communication style

- Ask questions early and often
- Confirm understanding before taking action
- Present technical decisions as options, not fait accompli
- When suggesting changes, explain "why" and wait for go-ahead

### ℹ️ Application name: Project Brayford

- The application is called "Project Brayford"
- It is never acceptable, under any circumstances to shorten this to "Brayford". Always use the full name.

### 🇬🇧 Language: UK English for public-facing copy only

**Rule:** If a user can see it without opening developer tools, it must be UK English.

- ✅ **UK English required:**
  - UI copy (buttons, labels, error messages, notifications)
  - Marketing pages and landing pages
  - User-facing documentation (help docs, FAQs, onboarding)
  - Email templates
  - Error messages shown to users
- ✅ **US English acceptable:**
  - Code (variables, functions, comments)
  - Internal documentation (READMEs, architecture docs)
  - Database schemas and collection names
  - API routes and endpoints
  - Library/framework conventions (e.g., `color` in CSS must stay as-is)

**Example:** A button label says "Organise Event" (UK), but the code calls `createOrganization()` (US).

### 🎬 Production Ready

- All code must be production-ready quality, even in early stages
- It is _never_ acceptable to use alert() style messaging. All user-facing messages must be presented in proper components with appropriate styling and UX patterns.

## Project Overview

Real-time "second screen" interaction platform for live events (podcasts, creator shows). Handles 5,000+ concurrent participants per event. Four Next.js apps + shared packages in a pnpm workspace. Firebase (Firestore + Realtime DB) for real-time sync. See [docs/DOMAIN_MODEL.md](../docs/DOMAIN_MODEL.md) for full architecture.

## Critical Patterns

### Real-time Firebase Operations

- **Always use jitter for concurrent writes** to prevent Firestore saturation (500 writes/sec limit)
  ```typescript
  import { withJitter } from "@brayford/firebase-utils";
  await withJitter(() => updateDoc(ref, data), { windowMs: 2000 });
  ```
- **Always unsubscribe from `onSnapshot` listeners** in `useEffect` cleanup
- Follow patterns in `packages/firebase-utils` for real-time hooks

### TypeScript Standards

- Strict mode enabled everywhere - explicit return types on exported functions
- Use branded types for domain IDs: `type EventId = string & { readonly __brand: 'EventId' }`
- Validate Firestore data with Zod schemas from `packages/core/src/schemas`
- Import order: external → internal packages (`@brayford/*`) → relative → styles

### Component Architecture

- **Server Components by default** - only add `'use client'` for interactivity, real-time listeners, or browser APIs
- State management: Zustand for global UI, custom Firebase hooks for real-time data, React Hook Form for forms
- Optimize with Zustand selectors: `const x = useStore(s => s.x)` not `const store = useStore()`

### Domain Model (see [docs/DOMAIN_MODEL.md](../docs/DOMAIN_MODEL.md))

- 7-domain architecture: Identity, Organization, Event Management, Interaction, Audience, Billing, Analytics
- Hierarchy: **Organization** (paying customer) → **Brands** (public-facing) → **Events** (live shows) → **Modules** (Q&A, polls) → **Interactions** (votes, questions)
- Multi-tenancy: Events belong to Brands, Brands belong to Organizations, Users are Organization members

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS with mobile-first approach
- Use `clsx` for conditional classes
- CSS Modules only for complex animations not suitable for Tailwind

### Naming Conventions

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Hooks: `camelCase` with `use` prefix (files: `kebab-case`)
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Firebase collections: lowercase plural (`events`, `questions`)
- Branches: `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/` + short description
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`feat(scope): description`)

## Development Workflow

### Commands (from root)

```bash
pnpm dev        # Run all apps in parallel
pnpm build      # Build all apps
pnpm test       # Run all tests
pnpm lint       # Lint all packages
```

### Before Committing

1. Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm type-check`
2. Ensure tests pass with 70%+ coverage for packages, 50%+ for apps
3. Use Conventional Commits format
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** for user-facing changes (see below)

### Maintaining CHANGELOG.md

**Always update CHANGELOG.md** when implementing features, fixes, or changes that affect users or other developers.

**When to update:**

- ✅ New features (UI components, API endpoints, database schemas)
- ✅ Bug fixes (especially user-facing issues)
- ✅ Breaking changes (API changes, schema migrations, removed features)
- ✅ Security patches
- ✅ Performance improvements
- ✅ Dependency updates (major versions only)
- ❌ Internal refactoring with no external impact
- ❌ Test additions (unless they document new behavior)
- ❌ Documentation typo fixes

**How to update:**

1. Add changes under `## [Unreleased]` section
2. Use categories: `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, `Security`, `Deprecated`
3. Write from user/developer perspective: "what can they now do?" not "what code changed"
4. Reference issue numbers if applicable: `- Fix auth race condition (#123)`
5. When releasing, move Unreleased items to new versioned section with date

**Example entry:**

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Event Management**: Create and schedule live events with QR codes for audience entry
- **Dashboard**: Event list with status filters (draft, live, ended)

### Fixed

- Auth token refresh now works correctly after 1 hour (#145)
```

### Testing

- Vitest + Testing Library for unit/component tests
- Playwright for E2E (critical flows: submit question → appears on stage view)
- Test business logic, shared utilities, and critical user flows
- Mock Firebase operations in tests

## Key Files

- [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) - Version history with user-facing changes (keep updated!)
- [docs/ROADMAP.md](../docs/ROADMAP.md) - Feature progress and sprint planning
- [docs/DEVELOPER_STANDARDS.md](../docs/DEVELOPER_STANDARDS.md) - Comprehensive style guide
- [docs/DOMAIN_MODEL.md](../docs/DOMAIN_MODEL.md) - Data models and domain boundaries
- `packages/core` - Shared types, schemas, constants
- `packages/firebase-utils` - Real-time hooks and jitter logic
- Root `package.json` - Monorepo scripts and tooling config

## Performance Considerations

- **Jitter is non-negotiable** for writes during "Vote Now!" moments (5,000 concurrent users)
- Debounce user input (500ms) before Firebase queries
- Use optimistic updates for instant UI feedback
- Memoize expensive computations with `useMemo`
- Lazy-load heavy client-only components with `dynamic` import

## Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Writing to Firestore without jitter in audience-facing features
- ❌ Not unsubscribing from Firebase listeners (memory leaks)
- ❌ Using `const store = useStore()` (causes unnecessary re-renders)
- ❌ Adding `'use client'` to components that could be Server Components
- ❌ Type assertions without validation (`as Event` without Zod parse)
